            <h4>Did you know?</h4>
            <p>
                <script>guessingGame();</script>
                In Norse mythology a squirrel named "Ratatoskr" Was the carrier of information and would climb both up and down the tree of life, to deliver news from the eagle up top and the serpant who would dwell below near the roots of the tree of life.
            </p>
            <h4>Today they are known alittle different</h4>
            <p>Today most know squirrels as "bird feeder raiders", besides them being those critters you see at the parks running up and down the tree's, most people are more familiar with them being a big culprit as to why their newly hung bird feeders are either <i>empty</i> or even <bold>knocked down</bold> all together. Their antics and energy are undeniable, however did you know they are also natures "arborists"? at one point or another we have all heard the term "squirrel away" when refering to tucking something away perhaps for a <i>rainy day</i>. Squirrels do this all day (after they get their fill) they take nuts and cache them, somewhere safe for whenever they may need them. Well <i>Did you know?</i> that squirrels plant millions of trees every year simply because they cache a nut and just forget where they put it. Infact! chestnut tree's heavily rely on squrriels alone for this very reason (you can read more on that <a href="https://nedhardy.com/2020/02/10/squirrels-plant-trees/" target="_blank">here</a>). Well with deforestation and the constant expanding of the suburbs are losing their homes due to trees being cut down, some even become orphaned due to cars hitting many squirrels, which leaves up to 2-4 kits per litter helpless... This is where we come in.

            <h4>Our Mission</h4>
            <p> Our mission is simple, we are here to offer a platform where we are able to rehabilitat  direct people to licensed rehabilitaters in their area to help these littl guys and girls. We also offer an avenue for people to "adopt a squirrel" where people are able to donate money and recieve a picture (email or physical) on which little buddy they are aiding. We also have a small <a>merch</a> section where all the funds are directed to the aid of our squirrels which keeps then fed and housed.
